    "In recent years, Python has emerged as one of the standard tools for data science and machine learning, owing in large part to the availability of libraries for efficiently storing data and performing computations with it. Since Python is an interpreted language, it is generally not as fast as compiled languages such as C, but in some domains (such as ours!) the bottleneck lies in number crunching and linear algebra routines that can be accessed via a high-level API without sacrificing much performance.\n",

    " * *type*: the type of objects in the array. This will typically be floating-point numbers for our purposes, but other types can be stored.  The type of an array can be accessed via the `dtype` attribute.\n",
    " * *shape*: the dimensions of the array. This is given as a tuple, where element $i$ of the tuple tells you how the \"length\" of the array in the $i$th dimension. For example, a 10-dimensional vector would have shape `(10,)`, a 32-by-100 matrix would have shape `(32,100)`, etc. The shape of an array can be accessed via the `shape` attribute.\n",
