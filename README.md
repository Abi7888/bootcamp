Thank you ML@B members: @blchu, @raulpuric, and @philkuz!

Most of the material was taken from Berkeley's CS189 course. Many thanks to Professor Jonathan Shewchuck, who taught the course during the Spring 2016! Here's the reference to his notes (I VERY MUCH suggest this for a stronger mathematical understanding behind the algorithms): https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/papers/machlearn.pdf
